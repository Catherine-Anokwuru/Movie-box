- The search bar is not functional
- The navbar and sidebar are not functional
- There is no button for navigating back to previous page
- There is no authentication functionality
- Mobile responsiveness is a bit iffy, as the aim of this project was fetching from APIs, therefore much concentration wasn't put in perfecting responsiveness across all devices
